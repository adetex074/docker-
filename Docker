I have learn how to Install, configure and use docker hub on the terminal, i have learn basics commands of docker and how to push my images to my local repository. Also, i have learn how to configure security group on my EC2 instance, getting it to face public, so there i can launch the Url created from the docker images seamlessly  
This is a good project to learn more about images and containers, i have also learn how to use command to start and stop container, i have also learn the difference between run command and start command, i have been able to start a container, stop and restart a container.
